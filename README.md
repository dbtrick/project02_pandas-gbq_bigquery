# Project: Google BigQuery and Python (pandas-gbq)

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to a data engineering project leveraging Google BigQuery and Python, specifically utilizing the pandas-gbq library. The project aims to streamline data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes from Google BigQuery, enabling efficient handling and manipulation of large datasets for analytics and reporting purposes.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Planning and Implementation
- **Objective**: Designing the architecture and workflows for data extraction, transformation, and loading using pandas-gbq with Google BigQuery.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Define data sources and schema requirements.
  - Set up project environment and dependencies.
  - Plan data extraction strategies from Google BigQuery.
  - Design data transformation processes using pandas.
  - Establish data loading procedures back into Google BigQuery.
  
## Next Steps
- Finalize project architecture and workflow design.
- Begin implementation of data extraction and transformation scripts.
- Test and validate ETL processes.
- Document code and processes for future reference.
